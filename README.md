## Not needed to run showcase version

Build with React.js

Styling and layout controlled by .css files

"Components" folder + App.js have all the <div> items seen in the browser. 
- OptionsSection is the bottom part of the browser, has all user interaction
- QueueSection is the left side of the browser, shows "Queue" data received from backend
- AgentSection is the right side of the browser, shows the "AgentsOnline" data received from backend

"Custom" has hard coded values that require manual maintenance.

"Services" folder has the connections to backend

"Utils" folder has some formatting functions

At the momoent App.js does most of the business logic.

### `npm start`
